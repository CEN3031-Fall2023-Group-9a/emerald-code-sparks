# Style Guide
## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for the visual presentation of our application. It outlines the use of colors, typography, and other key elements that ensure a consistent style across multiple pages.

## Importing Styles
For every less file, the first import should be a local address to style.less which is located in `[repo]/client/src/assets/style.less`. This document can be used for references to several colors (stored as #colors[type] in the file) and other objects that we will referring to in this document.

## Color Palette

Utilize the following primary colors defined in `style.less` to ensure brand consistency:


-   **Primary**: `#colors[primary]` (light blue)
-   **Secondary**: `#colors[secondary]` (another shade of blue)
-   **Tertiary**: `#colors[Tertiary]` (off-white)
-   **Quaternary**: `#colors[quaternary]` (yellow)
-   **Quinary**: `#colors[quinary]` (golden yellow)
-   **Text-Primary**: `#colors[text-Primary]` (dark grey for text)
-   **Text-Secondary**: `#colors[text-Secondary]` (white for text on dark backgrounds)

These colors should be consistently used for UI elements such as backgrounds, text, and buttons.

# Background

The background should be a light blue color (#colors[primary]). Should be the lowest layered value in the object.  It's a completely static object that should not change at any time.

# Text Boxes

The background for all text boxes will be white (#colors[tertiary]) with the text color being black (#colors[text-primary]).

# Fonts

(what will be primary font, highlighted font, etc)
All text in this document will be assumed to be in the font "KOULEN" unless stated otherwise. 

# Dropdown Menus 
### About Dropdown

Functionality: A user interface element designed to offer a list of options or links. When the user clicks or hovers over the primary label (in this instance, "About Dropdown"), the list expands downwards to display multiple related items.

Design: The dropdown menu has a clear heading, "About Code Sparks", which possibly indicates the main category or section. Beneath this heading, there are three distinct options listed vertically: "HOW IT WORKS", "OUR TEAM", and "FAQ". 

Font: Each option is presented in uppercase letters, in font “KOULEN”.

Interaction: Users can access the options within the dropdown by clicking on the main label. Once clicked, the list expands to present the available choices. After selecting or clicking elsewhere on the page, the dropdown menu retracts (I’m assuming it will?).
